Developer Setup
--------------
The SDK can be obtained by adding it as a maven dependency, cloning the source into your project, or by downloading one of the precompiled JARs from the releases page on GitHub.

Gradle: 
```groovy 
compile 'com.box:box-android-share-sdk:1.0.0'
```
Maven: 
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.box</groupId>
    <artifactId>box-android-share-sdk</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

If not using Gradle or Maven, this SDK has the following dependencies and will need to be included in your project:
* [box-android-sdk](https://github.com/box/box-android-sdk) (maven: `com.box:box-android-sdk:3.0.2`)


Quickstart
--------------
You will need a BoxSession and the BoxItem from the [box-content-sdk](https://github.com/box/box-android-content-sdk). Please refer to the documentation of the box-content-sdk for additional details.
```java
    BoxSession session = new BoxSession(MainActivity.this);
    BoxFolder folder = new BoxApiFolder(session).getInfo("<FOLDER_ID>").send();
```

####File or Folder Shared Link
To manage an item Shared Link, launch the following activity:
```java
    startActivity(BoxSharedLinkActivity.getLaunchIntent((MainActivity.this, folder, session));
```
This activity allows you to manage all the settings of a Shared Link (for a specific File or Folder): password restriction, permissions, expiration date, access level, etc.

####Folder Collaborators
To manage Folder collaborators, launch the following activity:
```java
    startActivity(BoxCollaborationsActivity.getLaunchIntent(MainActivity.this, folder, session));
```
This activity allows you to manage user access and permissions to a specific Folder.
